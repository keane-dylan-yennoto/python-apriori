# Apriori Algorithm for Counting Frequent Itemsets

The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm for mining frequent itemsets in a dataset. It uses a combination of candidate generation and pruning to efficiently count the support of itemsets of increasing size.

The code in this repository is an implementation of the apriori algorithm using python.
